# HitBoxEditor

This is a simple programming project using winforms that's purpose is to create hitbox properties to allievate trial and error in Monogame hitbox set up. The idea is simple: Open an image, create a rectangle where you want the hitbox and export each hitbox property to a JSON file. Currently in development and should hopefully not take long!
